# COS23

## Using this project in a browser via GitHub Codespaces

1. First [log in](https://github.com/login) to an existing GitHub account or [create an account](https://github.com/signup).
2. Click this button:  
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/bencroker/cos23?quickstart=1)
3. In the resulting window, you can see and open any existing Codespaces by clicking on them, otherwise you can click the “Create new codespace” button to create a new one.
4. After a few moments, you should see the Terminal window open and a stream of commands as the project is set up.
5. Wait until you see output like this, and then access the site via the credentials that are output on the console:

```
queue_1    | ### Your Craft site is ready!
queue_1    | Frontend URL: https://khalwat-opulent-xylophone-q59g6p5vqj3rvr-8050.preview.app.github.dev/
queue_1    | CP URL: https://khalwat-opulent-xylophone-q59g6p5vqj3rvr-8050.preview.app.github.dev/admin
queue_1    | CP User: admin
queue_1    | CP Password: project
```

The first time you start up your project in Codespaces, it'll take some time to set everything up. However, subsequent startups will be very quick.

You can access your existing Codespaces here:

https://github.com/codespaces

Click on one to resume it. If you don't see a Terminal window, go to the hamburger  menu in the top-left, and click on **Terminal > New Terminal**. You can run the command `make start` to start the project. 

You can use the Codespaces editor to edit Twig files, load the site frontend, or log into the Craft CP, all from within a browser!
